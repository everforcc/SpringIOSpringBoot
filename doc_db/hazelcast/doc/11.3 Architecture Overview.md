- The fundamental key components of Hazelcast are as follows:
- Hazelcast的基本关键组件如下:

- A member is the computational and data storage unit in Hazelcast. Typically it is a JVM.
- 成员是Hazelcast中的计算和数据存储单元。它通常是一个JVM。

- A Hazelcast cluster is a set of members communicating with each other. Members which run Hazelcast automatically
  discover one another and form a cluster at runtime.
- Hazelcast集群是一组相互通信的成员。运行Hazelcast的成员会自动发现彼此，并在运行时形成集群。

- Partitions are the memory segments that store portions of data.
- 分区是存储部分数据的内存段。
- They are distributed evenly among the available cluster members.
- They can contain hundreds or thousands of data entries each, depending on the memory capacity of your system.
- Hazelcast also automatically creates backups of these partitions which are also distributed in the cluster.
- This makes Hazelcast resilient to data loss.
