Hopefully, this section provided some of the Spring Boot basics and got you on your way to writing your own applications. If you are a task-oriented type of developer, you might want to jump over to spring.io and check out some of the getting started guides that solve specific “How do I do that with Spring?” problems. We also have Spring Boot-specific “How-to” reference documentation.

Otherwise, the next logical step is to read using.html. If you are really impatient, you could also jump ahead and read about Spring Boot features.
