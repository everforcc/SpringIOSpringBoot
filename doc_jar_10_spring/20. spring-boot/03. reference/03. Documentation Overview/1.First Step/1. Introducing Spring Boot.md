Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs “spring scripts”.

Our primary goals are:

- Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.（为所有Spring开发提供一个非常快速和广泛可访问的入门体验。  ）
- Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.（要固执己见，但当需求开始偏离默认值时，要迅速离开。  ）
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).（提供大类别项目(如嵌入式服务器、安全性、度量、运行状况检查和外部化配置)中常见的一系列非功能特性。  ）
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.（绝对不生成代码，也不需要XML配置。  ）
